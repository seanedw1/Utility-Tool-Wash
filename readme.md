# install
Write the below code in the terminal for your application.
```
npm i -s utilitytoolwash
```



### How to Use the Package

Add a directory and log file **log/debugs.log** into your root to grab all the log queries from **utilitytoolwash**

```
// Add log directory and debugs.log files to root of your application
mkdir log
cd log
touch debugs.log
```

#### Example
```
// Call The Module into a script
const dataLog = require('utilitytoolwash');

// Use the utilitytoolwash
// Debug = ON Console.logging Data into log file
  dataLog(`${new Date()}`, 'Our Server is Running', port);
```
<br>

Make sure to follow these steps when using the data to log into your log directory.

```
//Used: date, message and object in it.
dataLog(`${new Date()}`, 'Our Server is Running', port);
```
Make sure when adding your **dataLog();** first comes the **date**, then the **text message** which explain the function or process that you wanna **console.log** out to the **.log directory** and finally the **object** you are using.
